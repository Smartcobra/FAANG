What is the Abstract Factory Pattern?

The Abstract Factory Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
Key Concepts:

    Factory: A factory is a class or method that creates objects. It’s like a machine that manufactures things (like buttons, cars, etc.).
    Abstract Factory: Instead of creating objects directly, you ask the abstract factory to create related objects for you.

Real-world Example: Vehicle Factory

Imagine you want to create a vehicle (like a car or truck). There are different types of vehicles that can have different parts (like wheels, engines, and seats), and each vehicle type might have specific parts.

You don’t want to manually pick every part for every vehicle. Instead, you want to ask a factory to give you a complete vehicle (car or truck) with all the parts pre-assembled.
Key Parts of the Example:

    Vehicle Types (Car, Truck)
    Parts (Wheels, Engine, Seats)

Step-by-Step Explanation of the Abstract Factory Pattern::
    Abstract Products: These are the parts that make up the vehicle. In this case, we’ll create interfaces for Wheels, Engine, and Seats.
    Concrete Products: These are the specific types of parts. For example, CarWheels, TruckWheels, etc.
    Abstract Factory: This factory defines methods to create these parts (Wheels, Engine, Seats). It’s the generic factory that allows you to create parts for a specific vehicle type.
    Concrete Factories: These are the specific factories that create the parts for a car or a truck


Summary of What Happened:

    Abstract Products: We defined the parts of a vehicle as interfaces — Wheel, Engine, and Seat.
    Concrete Products: We created specific types of parts for both Car and Truck.
    Abstract Factory: We created a VehicleFactory interface, which has methods to create the parts (Wheel, Engine, Seat) for the vehicle.
    Concrete Factories: The CarFactory and TruckFactory implement the VehicleFactory interface. They know how to create the parts for their respective vehicles.
    Client Code: The client uses the factory to get a full set of parts for a car or truck without knowing the details of how each part is created.
