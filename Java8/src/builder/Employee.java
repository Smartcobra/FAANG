Pros:

    You can construct objects step-by-step, defer construction steps, or run steps recursively.
    You can reuse the same construction code when building various representations of products.
    Single Responsibility Principle. You can isolate complex construction code from the business logic of the main class.

Cons:

    The overall complexity of the code increases since the pattern requires creating multiple new classes.
