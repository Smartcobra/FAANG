1. What Happens If You Override a Private Method?
Question:
Can we override a private method in Java?
Explanation:

No, private methods cannot be overridden because they are not visible to subclasses. However,
 if you define a method with the same name in a subclass, it is considered method hiding, not overriding.

 2. Can You Catch an Exception Thrown in a Static Block?
 Exceptions thrown in a static block can only be caught within a static initializer block using a try-catch. Otherwise, the program will fail to load the class.
