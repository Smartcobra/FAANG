1)
Problem Statement

There are
N items, numbered 1,2,…,N. For each i (1≤i≤N), Item i has a weight of w[i] and a value of v[i]

Taro has decided to choose some of the
N items and carry them home in a knapsack. The capacity of the knapsack is W, which means that the sum of the weights of items taken must be at most

W.

Find the maximum possible sum of the values of items that Taro takes home.
Constraints

    All values in input are integers.

1≤N≤100
1≤W≤10^9
1≤ wi ≤W
1 ≤vi ≤ 10^3

2)
Bob came to a cash & carry store, put n items into his trolley, and went to the checkout counter to pay.
Each item is described by its price ci and time ti in seconds that a checkout assistant spends on this item.
 While the checkout assistant is occupied with some item, Bob can steal some other items from his trolley.
 To steal one item Bob needs exactly 1 second. What is the minimum amount of money that Bob will have to pay to the checkout assistant?
  Remember, please, that it is Bob, who determines the order of items for the checkout assistant.
Input

The first input line contains number n (1≤n≤2000). In each of the following n lines each item is described by a pair of numbers ti, ci (0≤ti≤2000,1≤ci≤109). If ti is 0, Bob won't be able to steal anything, while the checkout assistant is occupied with item i.
Output

Output one number — answer to the problem: what is the minimum amount of money that Bob will have to pay.
