How to design?

    Data Structure: Use a ConcurrentHashMap to track requests per user.
    Fixed Time Window: Maintain a fixed window (e.g., 1 second) for rate-limiting.
    Threshold: Define a maximum number of requests per window per user.
    Thread-Safety: Ensure thread-safe operations for concurrency.



nternals:

Data Structure:

    A ConcurrentHashMap maps each user (userId) to a UserRequestTracker.
    UserRequestTracker keeps track of the request count and the start time of the window.

Rate Limiting:

    Each request checks if the current time exceeds the window size for the user.
    If yes, the tracker resets; otherwise, the request count increments.
    If the count exceeds the maxRequests, the request is rejected.

Concurrency:

    The synchronized block ensures thread safety while checking/updating the tracker.
