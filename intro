I am a highly skilled and versatile Full Stack Developer with over a decade of experience designing, developing, and
 delivering robust, scalable, and user-focused software solutions. My expertise lies in leveraging modern web development
 technologies, with a strong focus on Java Spring Boot for back-end development and React for creating dynamic and responsive front-end interfaces.

Throughout my career, I have consistently demonstrated a deep understanding of software architecture, design patterns, and agile methodologies.
I specialize in building end-to-end systems, integrating secure APIs, optimizing database performance, and ensuring seamless user experiences. My ability to adapt to evolving technologies and deliver production-grade solutions has been a cornerstone of my success.
Key Highlights:

    Back-End Expertise: Extensive experience in building RESTful APIs, microservices, and enterprise-grade applications using Java Spring Boot.
    Front-End Development: Proficient in developing interactive and responsive UI components using React, Redux, and modern JavaScript/TypeScript.
    Database Management: Skilled in working with relational databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL) and NoSQL solutions (MongoDB, Redis).
    DevOps & CI/CD: Hands-on experience with Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, and cloud platforms like AWS and Azure for deployment and scalability.
    Team Leadership: Proven ability to mentor teams, lead projects, and collaborate with cross-functional stakeholders to deliver high-quality software.

 My deep understanding of microservices principles, including loose coupling, domain-driven design, and event-driven architecture, enables me to craft solutions that are efficient, fault-tolerant, and highly available.
 I am well-versed in the end-to-end development lifecycle, from design and implementation to deployment and monitoring in production environments.

 Microservices Development: Expertise in developing RESTful APIs and asynchronous messaging systems using Java Spring Boot and tools like Kafka and RabbitMQ.
 Cloud-Native Solutions: Proficient in deploying microservices to cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud, and leveraging tools such as Kubernetes and Docker.
 Database Expertise: Skilled in working with both SQL and NoSQL databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB) for designing highly efficient data storage solutions.
 DevOps Integration: Hands-on experience with CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and GitLab CI, ensuring seamless code integration and deployment.
 Observability & Monitoring: Strong knowledge of monitoring and debugging distributed systems using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).
 Scalability & Resilience: Adept at implementing scalability patterns such as circuit breakers, retries, and load balancing for resilient systems.
